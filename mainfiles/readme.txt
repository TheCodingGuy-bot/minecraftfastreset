To run use:

#INSTALL THE MAINFILES DIRECTORY

#as it will delete your previous world
```


#DO NOT MOVE YOUR MOUSE DURING THE PROCESS OF IT CLICKING OR MOVING THE MOUSE, WHEN YOU SAVE AND QUIT TO TITLE MAKE SURE TO LET IT DO WHAT IT HAS TO. 

The program will tell you the confidence score of how confident it thinks it is that, that button is on the screen when you save and quit to title. When its confident enough it will start clicking and creating a new world for you. I am not responsible for any damages this program can cause. By downloading my file you accept all risks and establish you want to install it.
The three buttons are there to find and click and once it finds the first button theres no need for continous screenshot with while true

Main delete file will see when the singleplayer button is there and delete the current world, you just played and start a new one so you save on space.

Thank you for using this software.
